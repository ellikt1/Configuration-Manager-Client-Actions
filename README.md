<h2>Description</h2>
This PowerShell script allows you to trigger client actions available in the Configuration Manager Client Application (ConfigMgr Client App) from the control panel, both locally and remotely. This script offers a practical solution for automating tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention. For more information, the differences between the ConfigMgr Client App and SCCM Software Center are also discussed.
